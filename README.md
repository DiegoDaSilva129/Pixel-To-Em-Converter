# Pixel-To-Em-Converter
Pixel To Em Converter as a chrome extension.

The logo has not been added to this file for this to work you would have to
add a logo png and change the manifest.json file. 

I created this just as a simple way that i could do this specific task in my browser without having to pull out my calculator.
